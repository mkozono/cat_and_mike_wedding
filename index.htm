			<h2>The Wedding Ceremony</h2>
			<p>Please arrive at 2:00 PM</p>
			<p>St. Augustine Church<br />
			130 Ohua Avenue<br />
			Honolulu, Hawaii 96815</p>
			<p>This beautiful church is Catherine's father's (Dr. Wallace Matthews) parish.  It has a rich history dating back to 1854.  Their mission is "to radiate love" and they demonstrate that mission daily by providing hot meals for those in need.  We feel blessed to be getting married in this church.</p>
			<p>Parking is located behind the church, off of Ohua Ave (a one-way street).  After entering the parking lot, handicap spots are to the left, on the side of the church.  If no spots are available, and you're up for a walk, you can park at the zoo.  Go south down Kalakaua, left on Kapahulu, it's on the right.</p>
			<p>For more information on the church visit: <a href="http://staugustinebythesea.com" target="_blank">http://staugustinebythesea.com/</a></p>
